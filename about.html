            <h1>About Taniti</h1>
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island has an area of less than 500 square miles, the
                terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests,
                and a mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about
                20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was dominated by fishing or agriculture.

            <p>
                Taniti enjoys a large number of national holidays, and many tourist attractions and restaurants will be closed on
                holidays, so visitors should plan accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Taniti uses the U.S. dollar as its currency, but many businesses will also accept euros and yen. Several banks
                facilitate currency exchange, and many businesses accept major credit cards.
